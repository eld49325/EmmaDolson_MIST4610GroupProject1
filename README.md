# Problem description
Our data model represents the social media app, Instagram. The model consists of user accounts, which have associated profiles, content, and followers/following relationships. Each post can have multiple associated media, such as images or videos, which users can interact with through likes, comments, and shares. Instagram also supports messaging between users and the creation of stories, which are temporary posts that expire after a set time period. Tracking user activity helps Instagram generate personalized recommendations and trends to improve user experience. Despite being one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, Instagram does allow its users schedule posts in advance or create communities of users who share similar interests. Our model demonstrates how the app could benefit from adding these features by identifying new insights Instagram could learn about its users.
